## **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

This document outlines the **Modular Monolith Pattern** used within our application codebase. By dividing it into self-contained modules, each representing a specific domain or feature. This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, reusability, and enables parallel development by clearly delineating boundaries.

Moreover, our architecture is designed to align with key software design principles—commonly known as the **SOLID principles**—which further enhance the quality and robustness of our codebase. Specifically:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each module has one well-defined purpose.  
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Modules can be extended without modifying existing code.  
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Implementations can be substituted with alternatives (e.g., through interfaces or abstract classes) without affecting system correctness.  
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Modules depend only on the interfaces they need.  
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules rely on abstractions rather than on concrete low-level modules.

By employing the Modular Monolith Pattern, we not only achieve a clear separation of concerns but also create an environment that naturally supports SOLID principles, resulting in a codebase that is robust, maintainable, and highly testable.

## **3\. Why Use the Modular Monolith Pattern?** {#3.-why-use-the-modular-monolith-pattern?}

1. **Clear Domain Boundaries**  
   * Each module focuses on a specific domain or feature set, reducing mental overhead.  
2. **Ease of Maintenance**  
   * A well-organized codebase accelerates debugging and feature enhancements.  
3. **Parallel Development**  
   * Teams can independently develop, test, and deploy modules, minimizing merge conflicts.  
4. **Transition to Microservices**  
   * If the need arises to split out a module (e.g., `order`) into its own service, the decoupled nature makes it easier to extract.  
5. **Refined Testing Strategy**  
   * Each module can include its own tests, improving test coverage and accuracy.  
6. **Incremental Refactoring**  
   * You can gradually migrate “spaghetti” code into well-defined modules over time.

**4\. SOLID Principles Overview**

Our project architecture adheres to the following SOLID principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each module/component is responsible for one aspect of the functionality, which minimizes complexity and improves maintainability.  
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Modules are designed to be open for extension but closed for modification, enabling new features to be added without altering existing code.  
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** By using interfaces and abstractions, components can be replaced with alternative implementations without affecting system behavior.  
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Modules only depend on the specific methods they require, reducing unnecessary coupling and improving modularity.  
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules do not depend on low-level implementations; instead, both rely on abstractions, which enhances flexibility and testability.

These principles, combined with the Modular Monolith Pattern, ensure that our application is not only modular but also robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## **5\. Project Architecture Overview** {#5.-project-architecture-overview}

The following structure illustrates how modules are organized in this project. This pattern—often called a *Modular Monolith*—maintains a single codebase but enforces logical boundaries and autonomy within each module.

`src/`  
`├── [module-name]/`  
`├── shared/`  
`├── shared-modules/`  
`└── index.ts`

* `src/`: Primary directory hosting all application logic.  
* `[module-name]/`: Self-contained domain or feature (e.g., `product/`, `order/`, `auth/`).  
* `shared/`: Global utilities, constants, and middleware used across modules.  
* `shared-modules/`: Cross-cutting modules (e.g., `logging`, `notifications`, `error`) used by other modules.  
* `index.ts`: The main application entry point (initializes the server, registers routes, etc.).

---

## **6\. Common Module Structure** {#6.-common-module-structure}

To maintain consistency, each module should follow a standardized internal layout:

`[module-name]/`  
`├── controllers/`  
`│   └── [module].controller.ts`  
`├── services/`  
`│   └── [module].service.ts`  
`├── routes/`  
`│   └── [module].route.ts`  
`├── validators/`  
`│   └── [module].validator.ts`  
`├── entities/`  
`│   └── [module].entity.ts`  
`├── repositories/`  
`│   └── [module].repository.ts`  
`├── serializers/`  
`│   └── [module].serializer.ts`  
`├── types/`  
`│   └── [module].type.ts`  
`├── constants/`  
`│   └── [module].constant.ts`  
`├── enums/`  
`│   └── [module].enum.ts`  
`├── tests/`  
`│   └── [module].test.ts`  
`├── [optional sub-modules]/`  
`│   └── [sub-module]/`  
`│       ├── ...`  
`│       └── index.ts`  
`└── index.ts`

* **Sub-modules**: If a domain is large, you can subdivide it further (e.g., `payment/`, `shipping/` under `order/`).  
* **Focus**: Each folder (e.g., `controllers/`, `services/`, `repositories/`) has a clear responsibility to prevent bloated files.

## **7\. Detailed Module Breakdown** {#7.-detailed-module-breakdown}

1. **controllers/**  
   * Orchestrates incoming requests, delegates to services, and structures responses.  
2. **services/**  
   * Core business logic; interacts with repositories or external APIs.  
3. **routes/**  
   * Defines HTTP endpoints and maps them to controller methods.  
4. **validators/**  
   * Implements general-purpose validation logic to verify data integrity and correctness throughout the application.  
5. **schemas/**  
   * Defines the structure and constraints of data objects using schema validation libraries. Schemas ensure data integrity and consistency across different parts of the application by specifying the expected shape, types, and validation rules of data. They serve as blueprints for both incoming data (e.g., API requests) and outgoing data (e.g., API responses).  
   * Note: Employs popular schema validation libraries to create and manage data schemas. These libraries provide robust tools for defining validation rules, transforming data, and handling complex validation scenarios. Some of the most commonly used schema libraries in Node.js include:  
     1. [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod):  
        A TypeScript-first schema declaration library that offers excellent type inference capabilities, making it a great choice for TypeScript projects.  
     2. [Joi](https://joi.dev/):  
        Ideal for defining comprehensive schemas with intricate validation rules. Joi is versatile and widely adopted in both backend and frontend projects.  
     3. [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup):  
        Known for its intuitive API and seamless integration with form management libraries in frontend frameworks. Yup is also suitable for backend validations.  
     4. [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator):  
        Utilizes decorators to define validation rules directly within TypeScript classes, promoting a clean and declarative approach to schema definitions.  
6. **entities/**  
   * Database schema definitions (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize) or domain model objects.  
7. **repositories/**  
   * Data persistence layer (e.g., database queries, external API integrations).  
8. **seeders**  
   * Scripts for seeding the database with initial or test data.  
9. **serializers/**  
   * Data transformation utilities (formatting responses or building requests).  
10. **types/**  
    * TypeScript interfaces/types relevant to the module.  
11. **constants/**  
    * Static values (like error messages, numeric constants) specific to the module.  
12. **enums/**  
    * Enumeration collections for strongly typed constants.  
13. **tests/**  
    * Unit or integration tests focusing on module-specific functionality.  
14. **fakes/**  
    * Contains fake implementations for testing purposes.  
    * These files serve as stubs or mocks for external dependencies, ensuring that dependency injection is type-safe and that fake implementations adhere to the defined interfaces or contracts.  
15. **\[optional sub-modules\]/**  
    * Nested module structure for very large or complex domains.  
16. **index.ts**  
    * Aggregates and re-exports items (e.g., routes, services) to simplify imports.

## **8\. Special Directories** {#8.-special-directories}

### **8.1 Shared** {#8.1-shared}

`shared/`  
`├── helpers/`  
`│   └── shared.helper.ts`  
`├── constants/`  
`│   └── shared.constant.ts`  
`├── types/`  
`│   └── shared.type.ts`  
`├── enums/`  
`│   └── shared.enum.ts`  
`├── middleware/`  
`│   └── shared.middleware.ts`  
`├── serializers/`  
`│   └── shared.serializer.ts`  
`└── index.ts`

* **Purpose**: Common utilities, constants, types, and middleware used throughout the application.  
* **Guidance**: Keep items here generic. If they’re domain-specific, move them to the relevant module.

### **8.2 Shared Modules** {#8.2-shared-modules}

`shared-modules/`  
`├── [shared-module-name]/`  
`│   ├── controllers/`  
`│   ├── services/`  
`│   ├── routes/`  
`│   ├── validators/`  
`│   ├── entities/`  
`│   ├── repositories/`  
`│   ├── serializers/`  
`│   ├── types/`  
`│   ├── constants/`  
`│   ├── enums/`  
`│   └── index.ts`  
`└── index.ts`

* **Purpose**: Cross-cutting modules that other modules may depend on (e.g., `logging/`, `notification/`, `error/`).  
* **Structure**: Identical to regular modules (with controllers, services, etc.), but intended for global concerns.

---

## **9\. Entry Point** {#9.-entry-point}

The `src/index.ts` file is the primary application entry. Example:

`import express from 'express';`  
`import productRoutes from './product/routes/product.route';`  
`import orderRoutes from './order/routes/order.route';`  
`// Import other modules as needed`

`const app = express();`

`// Global middlewares`  
`// app.use(...);`

`// Mount routes`  
`app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);`  
`app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);`  
`// Other routes...`

`// Error handling`  
`// app.use(...);`

`const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;`  
`app.listen(PORT, () => {`  
  ``console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);``  
`});`

**Notes**:

* Import each module’s routes and mount them under appropriate paths (e.g., `/api/[module]`).  
* Configure global middleware (e.g., CORS, authentication) here.  
* Include any global error-handling middleware.

## **10\. Automation and Enforcement** {#10.-automation-and-enforcement}

1. **Linters & Formatters**  
   * Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce style and best practices.  
2. **Code Generators**  
   * CLI tools or scripts that quickly scaffold new modules with the default directory structure.  
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   * Integrate linting, testing, and architectural checks into the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).  
4. **Documentation**  
   * Keep this document (or a summarized version) accessible.  
   * Encourage referencing it in pull requests, especially for major architectural changes.

---

## **11\. Usage Guidelines** {#11.-usage-guidelines}

1. **Module Creation**  
   * For new features or domains, create a dedicated folder in `src/` with the structure above.  
   * Export all publicly needed logic in the module’s `index.ts`.  
2. **Shared Resources**  
   * Place truly reusable logic in `shared/` or `shared-modules/`.  
   * If it’s specific to one domain, keep it inside that module.  
3. **Naming Conventions**  
   * Use `kebab-case` or `lowercase` folder and file names to avoid import issues.  
   * Maintain file names like `[feature].controller.ts`, `[feature].service.ts` for clarity.  
4. **Testing**  
   * Place module-specific tests under `tests/`.  
   * Strive for meaningful coverage to ensure reliability and code confidence.  
5. **Documentation**  
   * Add a `README.md` inside a module folder to outline domain-specific details, if complex.

---

## **12\. Best Practices** {#12.-best-practices}

1. **Avoid Cyclic Dependencies**  
   * Ensure modules do not import each other in loops. If multiple modules share functionality, refactor it into `shared/` or `shared-modules/`.  
2. **Keep Controllers Thin**  
   * Minimize business logic in controllers; delegate it to services for clarity and testability.  
3. **Enforce Clear Boundaries**  
   * Each module has its own domain. Avoid mixing responsibilities (e.g., `payment` logic in `user` module).  
4. **Use Dependency Injection**  
   * Pass services/repositories as parameters where appropriate, rather than creating them inline. This makes testing and maintenance easier.  
5. **Barrel Exports / Aggregators**  
   * Each folder’s `index.ts` can re-export items to simplify imports across modules.  
6. **Embrace Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
   * Align your modules with bounded contexts from DDD. For a large domain like `order`, you can create sub-modules like `payment/`, `shipment/`, `invoice/`, etc.  
7. **Principle of Least Knowledge**  
   * Modules should only expose what they need to. Keep internal files private if they are not meant to be used elsewhere.  
8. **Incremental Refactoring**  
   * Gradually convert legacy code into the new module structure to ensure a smooth transition without halting development.  
9. **Version Control Discipline**  
   * Keep pull requests small and focused on one module at a time to maintain clarity.  
10. **Monitor and Log**  
    * Use a central logging module (e.g., a `logging/` shared-module) to record critical events, errors, and performance metrics in a standardized way.

---

## **13\. Use Cases & Examples** {#13.-use-cases-&-examples}

1. **Authentication Module**  
   * `controllers/` handle login/logout endpoints.  
   * `services/` generate tokens, hash passwords.  
   * `validators/` ensure credentials meet format.  
   * `repositories/` interface with the user DB.  
2. **Product and Order Modules** (eCommerce)  
   * `product/` manages catalog, inventory, pricing.  
   * `order/` processes checkout, order creation, status updates, and orchestrates payment.  
   * `shared-modules/notification/` sends order confirmations.  
3. **Extracting to Microservices**  
   * If a module like `order/` becomes too large or performance-critical, it can be split into a separate microservice with minimal friction.

## **14\. Summary** {#14.-summary}

By employing the **Modular Monolith Pattern**, our project achieves clear domain boundaries, enhanced maintainability, improved reusability, and streamlined parallel development. This pattern is a design approach that groups related functionality into self-contained modules rather than being a set of rigid rules.

Furthermore, by aligning our architecture with the **SOLID principles**—ensuring that each module has a single responsibility, remains open for extension yet closed for modification, and relies on abstractions for dependencies—we significantly enhance our system’s scalability, flexibility, and testability. This synergy of modular design and SOLID principles results in a robust, adaptable, and future-proof codebase.
