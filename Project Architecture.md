**Project Architecture: Modular Monolith**  
**Our project is built using the Modular Monolith architecture**. This means the application is a single deployment unit, but its codebase is logically divided into distinct, self-contained modules. This approach promotes maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns, aligning strongly with SOLID principles.  
We explicitly avoid using barrel files (index.ts for re-exporting) to ensure dependency clarity and potentially better tree-shaking; imports should always point directly to the source file.

**Architecture Q\&A**  
This section addresses common questions about the Modular Monolith pattern chosen for this project.

* **Q: What does "single deployment unit" mean?**  
  * **A**: It means the entire application (all its modules and shared code) is packaged, built, and deployed as a single entity. If you update the product module, you redeploy the entire application, not just that module. This contrasts with Microservices, where each service is deployed independently. Operationally, it often translates to a single running process or a single container image for the whole backend.  
* **Q: What does "self-contained" mean for modules in this context?**  
  * **A**: While physically part of the same deployment, modules are logically independent. A "self-contained" module groups all code related to a specific business capability (e.g., order management). It should ideally expose a clear public interface (like services or specific routes) and hide its internal implementation details. Dependencies between modules should be minimal and explicit, flowing through these defined interfaces, rather than modules reaching deep into the internal code of others. This prevents the codebase from becoming a tangled "big ball of mud."  
* **Q: How does this pattern help apply SOLID principles?**  
  * **A**:  
    * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Modules themselves represent larger responsibilities (business capabilities). Within modules, classes/functions like services, controllers, and repositories further enforce SRP at a finer grain.  
    * Open/Closed Principle (OCP): You can often add new features by adding new modules or extending existing ones through well-defined interfaces, without drastic changes to unrelated modules.  
    * Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): While more about class design, clear interfaces between modules (e.g., using abstract repositories or service interfaces) encourage adherence to LSP.  
    * Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Modules expose only necessary functionalities through their defined interfaces (services, routes). Consumers (other modules or external clients) don't depend on internals they don't need. The shared/ directories also provide specific interfaces (types, middleware).  
    * Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Modules should depend on abstractions (interfaces, types defined often in shared/ or at the module boundary) rather than concrete implementations of other modules. Repositories abstract data access, and services abstract business logic, facilitating DIP.  
* **Q: Why choose the Modular Monolith Pattern?**  
  * **A**: It strikes a balance. We get the organizational benefits of modularity (like Microservices) without the significant operational overhead (deployment complexity, network latency, distributed transactions) that Microservices introduce. Frameworks like **NestJS heavily promote this kind of modular thinking**. It's often a good starting point for projects that may grow complex, allowing for better organization than a traditional monolith while keeping deployment and local development simple. Crucially, it **establishes clear boundaries from the start, providing a much smoother path for potentially extracting specific modules into separate microservices later** if business needs (like independent scaling or technology stacks) demand it.  
* **Q: Why not use a standard (non-modular) Monolith or jump straight to Microservices?**  
  * **A**:  
    * vs. Standard Monolith: Standard monoliths often lack clear internal boundaries, leading to high coupling ("spaghetti code"), making them hard to maintain, test, and understand as they grow. The modular approach enforces separation from the start.  
    * vs. Microservices: Microservices introduce significant complexity: managing multiple deployments, inter-service communication (network latency, failures), distributed data consistency, complex debugging/tracing, and potentially higher infrastructure costs. This complexity is often unnecessary, especially early in a project's lifecycle. The Modular Monolith avoids this overhead while still providing good code structure.  
* **Q: How does this pattern facilitate a future move to Microservices? Is it just copy/paste?**  
  * **A**: A key advantage is that well-defined modules, with clear interfaces and minimized dependencies, are significantly easier to extract into independent services compared to untangling code from a traditional monolith. It's not quite a simple copy/paste, but the groundwork is laid:  
    * **Code is already grouped by capability.**  
    * **Dependencies on other modules are (ideally) explicit and minimal**, often going through defined service interfaces or shared types.  
    * **Data ownership is clearer** (though database separation might still be needed).  
  * The extraction process would involve:  
    * Setting up a new, separate deployment environment for the new service.  
    * Copying the module's code into the new service's repository.  
    * Replacing direct in-process calls to the extracted module (from the monolith) with network calls (e.g., HTTP API calls, message queue events).  
    * Replacing direct in-process calls from the extracted module to other parts of the monolith with network calls.  
    * Handling shared dependencies (like shared/ code) – potentially creating shared libraries or duplicating and managing divergence.  
    * Addressing data access – deciding whether the new service gets its own database or still accesses a shared one (initially).  
* While still work, this is far less complex and risky than trying to carve out functionality deeply intertwined within a non-modular codebase

**Architectural Components**  
Before showing the full tree, let's define the main building blocks of the src/ directory:

1. index.ts: The single application entry point. Responsible for initializing the server, setting up global middleware, and mounting module routes.  
2. Domain Modules (\[domain-module-name\]/): Self-contained units representing specific business capabilities or features (e.g., product/, order/, auth/). These are the core building blocks of the application's functionality.  
3. Shared Utilities (shared/): A directory containing generic, reusable code (like helper functions, base types, universal constants) that is not specific to any single domain module and can be used across the application.  
4. Shared Modules (shared-modules/): Self-contained modules addressing cross-cutting concerns (like logging/, notification/, error-handling/). These are often more complex than simple utilities and might have their own internal structure and dependencies, serving multiple domain modules.

**Standard Directory Categories**  
To maintain consistency, we use a standard set of directory categories within our modules (\[domain-module-name\]/, shared-modules/\[module-name\]/) and the shared/ directory. Note that Domain Modules and Shared Modules generally follow the same internal categorization, while the top-level shared/ directory uses a subset relevant to global utilities.

Here are the standard categories and their purposes:

1. adapters/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules) Implements interfaces defined elsewhere, often acting as bridges to external systems or infrastructure details (e.g., an adapter implementing a repository interface using a specific database client, or an adapter for an external notification service).  
2. caching/: (Primarily shared/, sometimes Modules) Contains utilities, decorators, or configurations related to caching strategies. Module-specific caching logic could reside within its module.  
3. clients/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules) Contains code for interacting with external APIs or services (e.g., HTTP clients for third-party services relevant to a specific domain or shared concern).  
4. config/: (Modules, shared/, Root src/) Handles configuration loading, validation, and access. Can exist at the root for global config, in shared/ for shared config logic, or within modules for module-specific settings.  
5. constants/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules, shared/) Holds constant values. Module-specific constants (magic strings/numbers, config keys) go within modules. Global constants (e.g., default pagination size) reside in shared/constants/.  
6. controllers/: (Domain Modules) Handles incoming requests (e.g., HTTP), validates input (often using validators/schemas), delegates tasks to services, and formats outgoing responses.  
7. database/: (Primarily Root src/ or top-level project dir) Often holds database connection setup, migration runner configuration, and sometimes base model definitions or seeding orchestration. Module-specific seeders/ are common.  
8. decorators/: (Primarily shared/, sometimes Modules) Contains reusable custom TypeScript decorators (e.g., for logging, authentication, validation, caching).  
9. dtos/: (Modules, shared/) Data Transfer Objects. Explicitly defined objects used for transferring data between layers (e.g., from controllers to services, or in API responses). Often overlaps with schemas/ but can be more specific about transfer shapes.  
10. entities/: (Domain Modules) Represents core domain objects or database models/schemas (e.g., ORM definitions, database table schemas).  
11. enums/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules, shared/) Defines enumerations. Module-specific enums go within modules. Global enums (e.g., HttpStatus, Role) reside in shared/enums/.  
12. events/: (Modules, shared/) Defines event objects or types that are emitted or handled within the application.  
13. exceptions/ or errors/: (Primarily shared/, sometimes Modules) Defines custom application-specific exception/error classes.  
14. fakes/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules) Provides mock or stub implementations of dependencies (like repositories or external services) used during testing.  
15. guards/: (Modules, shared/) Contains authorization logic, often used with frameworks (like NestJS Guards) to protect routes or specific actions based on roles or permissions. Shared guards handle common auth checks.  
16. handlers/ or listeners/: (Modules, Shared Modules) Contains logic to react to specific events or messages (e.g., handling events emitted by services, processing messages from a queue).  
17. helpers/: (Primarily shared/) General-purpose utility functions (e.g., string manipulation, date formatting) usable anywhere.  
18. jobs/: (Modules, Shared Modules) Defines background jobs or tasks that can be queued and processed asynchronously (e.g., sending bulk emails, generating reports).  
19. lib/: (shared/, sometimes Modules) Often used as an alternative or supplement to helpers/ for more complex, self-contained utility libraries or wrappers around external libraries.  
20. middleware/: (Primarily shared/) Reusable application-wide middleware functions (e.g., authentication checks, request logging).  
21. migrations/: (Primarily Root src/ or database/) Contains database schema migration files (e.g., SQL scripts, ORM migration classes).  
22. policies/: (Modules, shared/) Similar to guards/, but can represent more complex authorization policies or rules, sometimes used in systems implementing policy-based access control.  
23. repositories/: (Domain Modules) Abstracts data access logic. Handles communication with databases, external APIs, or other persistence layers.  
24. routes/: (Domain Modules, sometimes Shared Modules) Defines API endpoints (e.g., HTTP routes) and maps them to specific controller methods.  
25. schemas/: (Domain Modules, shared/) Defines data structures, validation rules (e.g., using Zod, Joi), often for validating API inputs/outputs or internal data. Shared schemas define common structures.  
26. seeders/: (Domain Modules, database/) Contains scripts to populate the database with initial or default data. Often module-specific, but can be orchestrated globally.  
27. serializers/: (Domain Modules, shared/) Provides utilities for transforming data structures (e.g., formatting API responses, preparing data for external systems, converting between DTOs and entities).  
28. services/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules) Contains the core business logic, orchestrates operations, interacts with repositories/clients, emits events, and coordinates with other services or modules.  
29. tests/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules) Contains all tests (unit, integration, e2e, functional) related to the module or shared code. Often structured further (unit/, integration/, e2e/).  
30. types/: (Domain Modules, Shared Modules, shared/) Contains TypeScript definitions (interfaces, type aliases). Module-specific types go within modules. Global/shared types reside in shared/types/.  
31. utils/: (Modules) Sometimes used instead of helpers/ within a module for utility functions that are specific to that module and not intended for sharing.  
32. validators/: (Domain Modules, shared/) Implements reusable validation logic beyond basic schema checks, often used by controllers or services. Shared validators provide common validation functions.  
33. \[optional-sub-module\]/: (Domain Modules) For breaking down very large domain modules into smaller, nested modules following the same structural principles.

**Pros:**

1. **Simplicity (vs. Microservices):**  
   1. Single codebase simplifies debugging and tracing within the application boundary.  
   2. Single deployment process is easier to manage.  
   3. No network latency for calls between internal modules.  
   4. Atomic transactions across different "module" functionalities are simpler (within a single database).  
   5. Easier local development setup.  
2. **Organization (vs. Standard Monolith):**  
   1. Enforces logical boundaries between features/domains.  
   2. Improves code discoverability and understanding.  
   3. Reduces coupling compared to a non-modular monolith.  
   4. Facilitates parallel development on different modules (with clear interfaces).  
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes it easier to refactor or update specific parts of the application without unintended side effects elsewhere (if boundaries are respected).  
4. **Testability**: Modules can often be tested more independently than components in a tightly coupled monolith.  
5. **Clearer Migration Path to Microservices**: While not trivial, extracting a well-defined module into a separate microservice is significantly easier than carving out functionality from a tightly coupled traditional monolith. The logical boundaries, grouped code, and (ideally) explicit dependencies established by the Modular Monolith pattern provide a solid foundation for such a transition if required for scaling or other business needs. This reduces the risk and effort involved in evolving the architecture later.

**Cons:**

1. **Single Point of Deployment Failure:** If the deployment fails, the entire application is down.  
2. **Scalability Limitations (vs. Microservices):** The entire application must be scaled together, even if only one module is under heavy load. You cannot scale the product module independently of the order module.  
3. **Technology Stack Lock-in:** Typically, all modules share the same core technology stack, making it harder to introduce different languages or frameworks for specific parts.  
4. **Potential for Boundary Erosion:** Requires team discipline to maintain module boundaries. It's technically possible (though discouraged) for modules to become tightly coupled over time if rules aren't enforced.  
5. **Large Codebase Impact:** As the application grows, build times, test execution times, and IDE performance might degrade for the entire monolith.  
6. **Deployment Risk:** A change in one module, even if small, requires deploying the entire application, potentially risking regression in unrelated areas.
