# Uncomment the line for the model you want to use.
# Only ONE GEMINI_MODEL_NAME line should be uncommented at a time.

# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 # 	Enhanced thinking and reasoning, multimodal understanding, advanced coding, and more
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.0-flash             # Next generation features, speed, thinking, realtime streaming, and multimodal generation
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.0-flash-lite        # Cost efficiency and low latency
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-flash-latest
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-pro-latest # Usable but limit reached
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-pro

# --- Notes ---
# - Models like 'gemini-pro-vision' are typically used for specific multimodal tasks and might require
#   different API request structures than the current `:generateContent` method.
# - Embedding models (e.g., 'text-embedding-004') use different endpoints entirely (e.g., :embedContent).
